Tinyquant is a PyTorch quantisation library. It is designed to be easy to integrate and extend -- a universal interface for quantisation methods.

## Goals
- Feature parity with huggingface CUDA quantization integrations
- Tests for every quantisation method
- easily extendable toolkit for quantization of most common models
